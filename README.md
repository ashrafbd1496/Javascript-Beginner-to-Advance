# Sumit Saha Javascript Tutorial Practice

### Notes: 
__we can print or save the page using window.print();__

*we need to use document.write() for testing purpose only.*

* A good practice is to put spaces around operators ( = + - * / ):

_Fixed values are called Literals._

1.  Numbers are not allowed as the first character in names
2.  All JavaScript identifiers are case sensitive.
3.  Hyphens are not allowed in JavaScript. They are reserved for subtractions.

> JavaScript programmers tend to use camel case that starts with a lowercase letter: firstName, lastName, masterCard, interCity.

> Code after double slashes // or between /* and */ is treated as a comment.

> A const variable cannot be reassigned
