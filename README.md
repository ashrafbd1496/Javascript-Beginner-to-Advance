# Sumit Saha Javascript Tutorial Practice

### Notes: 
    * __we can print or save the page using window.print();__
    * *we need to use document.write() for testing purpose only.*
    * A good practice is to put spaces around operators ( = + - * / ):
    * _Fixed values are called Literals._
    1.  Numbers are not allowed as the first character in names
    2.  All JavaScript identifiers are case sensitive.
    3.  Hyphens are not allowed in JavaScript. They are reserved for subtractions.
    * -JavaScript programmers tend to use camel case that starts with a lowercase letter: firstName, lastName, masterCard, interCity.
    * -Code after double slashes // or between /* and */ is treated as a comment.
