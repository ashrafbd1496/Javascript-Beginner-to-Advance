# Sumit Saha Javascript Tutorial Practice

### Notes: 
    * we can print or save the page using window.print();
    * we need to use document.write() for testing purpose only.
    * A good practice is to put spaces around operators ( = + - * / ):
    * Fixed values are called Literals.
    * Numbers are not allowed as the first character in names
    * All JavaScript identifiers are case sensitive.
    * Hyphens are not allowed in JavaScript. They are reserved for subtractions.
    * JavaScript programmers tend to use camel case that starts with a lowercase letter: firstName, lastName, masterCard, interCity.
    * Code after double slashes // or between /* and */ is treated as a comment.
