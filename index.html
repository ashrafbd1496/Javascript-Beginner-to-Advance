    <h3>JavaScript Syntax</h3>
    <p>Fixed values are called Literals.</p>
    <p>Numbers are not allowed as the first character in names.</p>
    <p>All JavaScript identifiers are case sensitive.</p>
    <p>Hyphens are not allowed in JavaScript. They are reserved for subtractions.</p>
    <p>JavaScript programmers tend to use camel case that starts with a lowercase letter: firstName, lastName, masterCard, interCity.</p>
    <p>Code after double slashes // or between /* and */ is treated as a comment.</p>
